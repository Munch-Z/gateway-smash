      <strong>Rules</strong>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be respectful~ (Shit talk is allowed and encouraged, but keep it reasonable. If the person clearly does not
        enjoy/reciprocate. Stop.)
      </li>
      <li>All Johns (excuses) lead to negative points. Points deducted depends on the level of the John.</li>
      <li>
        Let's keep it clean. There's a lot of people and it can/will get hot. Please shower before you come, bring deodorant
        and use it liberally.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Commentator Guidelines:</strong> This event will be streamed and there will be live commentary. Anyone who
      wants to is welcome to be a commentator whether you have experience or not. Have fun with your commentary, this is not
      some high-level tournament. Talk with your co-caster before matches start and figure out the back and forth you guys
      have. Try and figure out before the tournament what kind of style and flow you want to have.
      <strong>
        It is highly encouraged to avoid play by play casting as Smash is not the best game for play by plays. Comment on
        good plays but talk about the match more than each individual action.
