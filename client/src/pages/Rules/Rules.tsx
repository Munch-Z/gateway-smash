        Be respectful~ (Shit talk is allowed and encouraged, but keep it reasonable. If the person clearly does not
        enjoy/reciprocate. Stop.)
      </li>
      <li>All Johns (excuses) lead to negative points. Points deducted depends on the level of the John.</li>
      <li>
        Let's keep it clean. There's a lot of people and it can/will get hot. Please shower before you come, bring deodorant
        and use it liberally.
