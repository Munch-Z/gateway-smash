Credits: This tournament has a credit system and the amounts of credits you have at the end decide your placing. Along with the “Bounty System” you are also able to bet your credits with other players either on your match OR on others. 
Bounty System: Every so often there will be a posted bounty on a player’s head. Bounties "Credits" will be based on previous results current number of credits players has and overall skill. Anyone may challenge a player with a bounty on their head, but it must be declared out loud and a set total must be agreed on (Bo1, Bo3, Bo5). When possible "Bounty Hunts" will be played on Mainstage so it can be streamed. If you challenge the criminal and win you get the bounty as well as 1/4th of their current credits. If you challenge the criminal and LOSE, they take 1/4th of your credits per win. Example if you challenged them to a Bo5 and lose 3-2 they will take 3/4th of your credits. IF you are seeded above the person and challenge them to a "Bounty Hunt" and lose, they take all your credits.
Missions: In this tournament there are special missions you can embark on to gain credits. These missions may be simple and achievable in a normal match while some may be difficult and require special circumstances to achieve. There will be a list of missions you can go on as well as the credit reward make sure to read the missions and decide which ones you are attempting to get to become a credit king.

All Johns lead to negative points. Points depend on the level of the John
Shower before the tournament. There will be a lot of people and it can get hot. Bring deodorant
Commentators Guideline: 
This event will be streamed and there will be commentary. Anyone may be a commentator weather you have experience or not. Have fun with your commentary, this is not some high-level tournament. Talk with your co-caster before matches start and figure out the back and forth you guys have. Try and figure out before the tournament what kind of style and flow you want to have. It is highly encouraged to not play by play cast as Smash is not the best game for play by plays. Comment on good plays but talk about the match more than each individual action.
